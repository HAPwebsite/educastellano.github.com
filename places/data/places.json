            "description": "The Taklamakan Desert, also known as Taklimakan and Teklimakan, is a desert in the southwest portion of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in northwest China. It is bounded by the Kunlun Mountains to the south, the desert Pamir Mountains and Tian Shan (ancient Mount Imeon) to the west and north, and the Gobi Desert to the east. The name is probably an Uyghur borrowing of Arabic tark, to leave alone/out/behind, relinquish, abandon + makan, place.  Another plausible explanation is that it is derived from Turki taqlar makan, which means the place of ruins. Popular accounts claim that Takla Makan means go in and you will never come out. It may also mean The point of no return or The Desert of Death. The Taklamakan Desert Ecoregion is a Chinese ecoregion of the Deserts and xeric shrublands Biome.",
